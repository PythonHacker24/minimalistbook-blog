    <h1>Arch Linux Custom Builds — Freedom of the Operating System</h1>

    

    <p>While writing this blog, I was reading the book “Linux Kernel in a Nutshell” by Greg Kroab-Hartman and as far as the pages of the book are concerned, it seems to be a two-day read (this is a handbook so reading it once and having around the desk is super useful). By the way, the author has the book left open for download <a href="http://www.kroah.com/lkn/">http://www.kroah.com/lkn/</a> so check that out if you want to follow up. I love reading physical books but having a soft copy of a book in the system is handy especially when it is a handbook. While reading this book, I was amazed by the fact that the Linux Kernel has about 2000 configurations that you can make to mould that Kernel as per your requirements. Which is yes, a lot when compared to firing up a Ubuntu USB medium and installing the device.</p>
<p>But the fact that you can tailor a system as much as you need is kind of interesting when you need the fastest system as your hardware. This blog is not about the Linux Kernel, would love to talk about that in some other blog since this is about Arch Linux. This is from my perspective and for a quick background, I was a Windows user till my 10th Grade (of course that is what I know) when I finally switched to Linux for the sake of learning security stuff and firing up Python (my first language) in Virtual Environment. After getting into college, I switched to macOS which has a Unix-like Kernel so I was happy about the fact that I could traverse the system with the ease of the terminal (and use security tools to bang some CTFs). But that was when I came to the point of feeling bound by the “safeguard” of the macOs. So I got myself the PC I used back a few years and got Arch Installed into it.</p>
<p>The fact that the Arch Linux is a simple and lightweight distribution is absolutely what means freedom. It’s simple so no junk or bloated software preinstalled to track the activity that you do which would make the system slower than the hardware can perform at your interest. Similarly, it goes for the lightweight, having a system so minimal that it would fire up nothing when you install it. Nothing installed would be without your permission. Choose what you need and that’s it. As simple as it is, maintenance is a whole lot of your responsibility so you need to know two or three about Linux Administration (which is a good thing if you are learning like me).</p>
<p>So what are you gonna do with nothing installed into it? My recommendation after installing the Arch Linux goes with Suckless Utilities (topic for another blog). They suck so less out of your system and are one of the most customizable software I have ever used. The slightest change you make, you have to build the software and then use the binary. The fact that there is no “Settings” option in the menubar (it is also not there by default) saves a lot of space and CPU utilisation. That optimise it is. Fully written in C Language and you can add your piece of code to customise it. It’s the thing that made you install Arch Linux, Sucking Less and here it is. DWM (Dynamic Window Manager), is so awesome and highly customisable. Like for example, I have written a script in Golang (my first lines in golang) for fetching the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. Right on the top of the screen. Suckless Terminal (ST), is a super fast and customisable terminal and a lot of configurations. A lot of them exist on the suckless website <a href="https://suckless.org/">https://suckless.org/</a> which you need to check out.</p>
<p>Now for the whole ricing part, it would be covered in some other blog which is a super big topic to cover in some single blog. This was a whole introduction to the ideology of Arch OS. This is the freedom that you acquire when you use this.</p>
<p>Hey, I am a learner by the way. I too have spent hours browsing the internet to expand my knowledge of Linux and Arch especially. I am just spreading the word that I have about my opinion of using the Arch OS. All is for learning purposes so take it with a pinch of salt. Arch has been one of the best things that happened to my life to learn and understand concepts underlying an Operating System.</p>
