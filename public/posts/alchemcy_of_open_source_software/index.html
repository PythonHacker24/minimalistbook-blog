<p>Open-source software has been there for a long time since the software industry started to get into some shape. Open-source is not just a way of developing software but a value that makes individuals in the community contribute to making their skills useful to the world. Lots of smart people out there have so much talent into them which can have a great impact on society, and it may be a case that they are under-estimated by the corporate world. Even it may be a case that a well-paid software developer might have a thing or two to donate to the well-being of society in the form of software. Nonetheless, the values are the same, to have greater freedom and more access to the software by as many people as we can.</p>
<p>If we just move our attention from just the software perspective and look at the way sites like Wikipedia and others distribute knowledge and learning for free without any return and survive on donations by the community as well as corporate firms is invaluable. I just can remember how handy Wikipedia has been for the whole of my school life and the majority of my high school for studying subjects in depth. I am currently studying computers in depth but back in the days when I used to study Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics, it was these free websites where I focused my attention towards. It was not the case that I hadn’t had access to paid stuff but it was my preference to use the works that are done openly and freely on the community. Even today I use Wikipedia to study and reference topics when I study books or even just scroll through the website in search of something new (the best thing about it is it’s very handy while using the Lynx browser running on the terminal on my Arch Linux and refer to topics while writing code is something awesome).</p>
<p>In the same way the spread of knowledge works, it’s the same for software distribution. One of the very successful and used Open-source projects is Linux. Linus Torvalds while studying at university started a hobby project of developing an Operating System which was Unix-like (Unix was licenced back in the day) which would go on to be free and open for contributions to all. It turns out that the project went on to acquire almost 96.3% of all servers out there (while writing the blog). Android, which is one of the most used Smartphone Operating Systems uses Linux Kernel. Linux got into various places and continued to be free and open for contribution. Linux Torvalds (while writing this blog) has been maintaining the Linux Source Code for more than 33 years now. People have been contributing and fixing issues in Linux and the whole project has got its nerves into the community.</p>
<p>The impact of open source can be seen almost everywhere. A lot of things that you use and are unaware of using open source software that has been built with near to no cost, by the community and not a big firm after a tedious hiring process. I believe that in today’s day if you are awesome enough to be bold, you can get your computer running with no paid software (given that you are ready to maintain it with no external support other than the community). You just have to get paid for the hardware. All the nerdy work you need to do can be done as it is with these tools. I use Arch Linux (btw) and run suckless utilities and even my browser is open source so I can have a look at the source code and confirm the possession of my data. In case I get any issues, I can resolve them on my own and even contribute to solving the issue for others. Find a bug and you can get it resolved on your own and further fix that in the repository.</p>
<p>Richard Stallman went on to start the GNU (GNU not Unix) Project where he supported the use of Free Software and a lot of tools that we use today are built under it. The Linux terminal usually uses the bash terminal which was made by the GNU Project. The tar, libc, more, make, etc and a lot more tools were built by them that we use today without acknowledging the people behind them. It’s not a single person, but a whole community behind them.</p>
