    <h1>Why I Shifted From Arch Linux to Debian Linux?</h1>

    

    <p><em><strong>Preface:</strong></em> <em>The following article is based on my personal experience with Arch Linux and Debian Linux. While I appreciate both distributions for their unique strengths and different use cases, the information provided reflects my own opinions and experiences. Your experiences may vary.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-was-i-going-for-initially">What was I going for Initially?</h2>
<h3 id="bit-of-my-story-as-a-beginner-linux-user">Bit of my Story as a Beginner Linux User</h3>
<p>When I started using Linux, I was going through security stuff and learning computer security when I was in my High School. At that time, I used to work with Kali Linux and that’s what I understood about Linux. I used to spent a lot of time on the terminal working with networking stuff, writing tools with Python, using pre-build tools to understand security, etc. and it was awesome. I was using the GNOME environment on Kali and eventually I shifted to XFCE (I prefer this for beginners). And to be honest, I knew nothing about desktop environments or I was no particularly interested in making my desktop look cooler than the default layout.</p>
<p>When I went to university, I started using MacOS, which is Unix-Based and gave a similar feeling of using Linux, since the shell I was using with was Bash (now I use ZSH). And for a year, I used MacOS as my main machine, until I got back to my custom built PC.</p>
<h3 id="my-first-arch-linux-build">My First Arch Linux Build</h3>
<p>When I got back my PC, I made it my main workspace where I started using Arch Linux. Trust me, I knew nothing about Arch Linux! I was blank when I first saw Arch Linux and how Minimal it was. I first went with Xfce as my desktop environment and started exploring Suckless Utilities (which I still use till this day).</p>
<p>I went on to understand tiling window managers and installed DWM (Dynamic Window Manager) since it was written in C and was super Minimal for my use. At that time, I learnt about editing the source code of the applications I use and customisation of these tools for my specific use and building them.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/PythonHacker24/Arch-Linux-Installation-Guide/blob/main/nvim.jpeg?raw=true" alt="arch"></p>
<p><em>This was my first Arch Linux Build (it&rsquo;s NeoVim on Suckless Terminal and DWM as window manager)</em></p>
<h3 id="my-experience-as-arch-user">My Experience as Arch User</h3>
<p>I was using Arch (BTW) as my main machine. This was the time when I learnt about using shell scripts to automate my workflow. I started learning tools and bind them with shell scripts to make my workspace as automated as possible. When I was a MacOS user, VsCode was my default text editor (and say my IDE), but when I shifted to Arch, I started to use NeoVim (I use NeoVim on my Macbook too now, I have no other text editor installed).
And let me be very honest as an Arch User, it breaks a lot. Many times, the Wi-Fi drivers used to crash and I would spend like multiple hours troubleshooting them to get by internet back. But I believe that this can be taken in two way, one is to consider it as waste of time, and another is the opportunity to learn how Wi-Fi drivers are configured to work. And I took it as the second way. I enjoyed the troubleshooting phase and always made out a solution. It use to feel sometimes that the problem is not gonna solve and after multiple hours or even days, somehow it used to get solved, making me 1% better at Linux after the use.</p>
<p>Arch Linux is a wild ride and it’s awesome. Somedays, I used to get so immersed in configuring it that I eventually use to forget my work and projects, while learning about ways to make it more functional and beautiful. I don’t regret it.</p>
<p>For curious readers, I used to use DWM, ST, DMENU, SLOCK as Suckless Utilities, Tmux as my Terminal Multiplexer, NeoVim with ChadVim configuration (I don’t much recommend it now, but totally for beginners and those who absolutely like it). Yes, I use systemd since it works and X11 as my display manager (maybe someday I will shift to wayland).</p>
<h2 id="what-made-me-shift-for-debian">What Made Me Shift for Debian?</h2>
<p>Yes, it a nice story to read and for me, an incredible experience. But then, I had to shift to Debian.</p>
<p>Debian is Linux Distro, which is widely used in personal computers and servers due to it’s stability and wide range of support. Distros like Ubuntu and Kali are based on Debian Linux. Debian is also minimal, especially when you install the raw version without any GUI and configure it yourself. It’s not as minimal as Arch Linux, but does the job well.</p>
<p>The word “stability” is the most important term which made me Distro Hop to Debian. As per my story suggest, I used to spend a lot of time fixing Arch and leaving my work aside, which was okay for me at that time, but when I started working on more important projects, it became tedious to manage my system.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/PythonHacker24/PythonHacker24/blob/main/desktop.png?raw=true" alt="debian"></p>
<p><em>My current Debian Linux Workspace (DWM). Yes, it&rsquo;s looks similar to the Arch ones, and it should since they are of same configuration, just build on their own system</em></p>
<p>This is due to the updates that Arch Linux gets. Packages that are installed on Arch are the latest and may not be always stable. Also, the newer versions are not necessarly compactible with other packages, causing it to break and take down the system (or in some cases, cause a functionality to break).</p>
<p>On the other hand, Debian gets major upgrades in two years while packages getting installed when they are finally stable. This makes Debian crash lot less often than what happens with Arch, making it an ideal Linux Distro for main machines with stable development environment.</p>
<h2 id="i-still-love-arch-linux">I Still Love Arch Linux!</h2>
<p>I do love Arch Linux and sometimes consider installing it on my other partition just for learning about it in depth or even as my main work machine. The fact that I ditro hopped is due to it’s unstable nature and temporary need of stability (or maybe I am just getting comfortable with it).</p>
<p>One thing that I can confess about my current Debian use is, I am learning less as compared to what I use to do in case of Arch. Surely I am productive on Debian working on my projects, but I miss the spontanity of getting issues to resolve and getting better everyday while learning how to fix problems in Linux. I think a day will come when I will permentantly shift to Arch Linux as my main distro and also be as productive as I am while using Debian.</p>
<h2 id="when-should-you-consider-jumping-from-one-another">When Should You Consider Jumping from One Another?</h2>
<p>If you are reading from the beginning, you might have figured out the answer.</p>
<p>When you have a lot of free time in your hand to learn about Linux, or you are new to the Linux world and need a challenges on your way to learn about it, or you need to stand out among the crowd and flex upon you Linux skills, Arch is ideal for use.</p>
<p>When you need a stable distro and a productive workspace, and you know what’s happening beneath the OS, and you really understand the working of stuff which you now want to be stable and not break while you do your work, go for Debian Linux.</p>
<p>It’s pretty evident of my answer to this question if you know my journey of using Linux on my main machine. But which ever distribution you use, keep learning and working on cool stuff. At that time, both feel good in their own way.</p>
